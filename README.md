# haskell-infinadd

`haskell-infinadd` is a Haskell library and executable which allow you to add numbers without having to worry about bounds! Just like with `Integer`!

Why though? If the feature already exists, why should we reinvent the wheel? Well, sometimes, it's more about the journey than the destination! The goal of this project is to learn how to use `megaparsec`, the C FFI and Embedded Domain Specific Languages.

Examples will be available at a later dateâ€¦
